## Overview

This repository contains a set of projects broken into course units focused on applying machine learning concepts using real datasets. Each unit includes Jupyter Notebooks illustrating data preparation, exploration, visualization, and modeling techniques.

Some example tasks include:
- Predicting survival outcomes (e.g., Titanic dataset)
- Exploring relationships between features and targets
- Building basic classification and regression models

This body of work reflects hands‑on practice with machine learning applications early in the learning process.
